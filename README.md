Window And Lock Screen, Applescripts. A collection of apple-scripts to perform some much-requested and still lacking basic features to move windows around and lock the screen using hot-keys.

Although I really don't like MS Windows much at all, it has a sparse few features that are actually quite convenient and sorely missed on OS-X. For one, Windows allows you to simply lock your screen with a quick hot-key combo. The second is a set of features, allowing you to move windows around your screen with some hot-keys, split-left/right, to the other screen, maximize and minimize.

I'm certainly not the first to come up with any of this stuff, my lockscreen script is just a simple implementation of somebody elses. My window-movers are losely based on other peoples work but implemented from scratch and vastly improved :)

> If you're going to use some of these scripts with hotkeys, be aware that using the `ctrl`-key will cause applescript to trigger a confirmation window. You will have to avoid using the `ctrl`-key in your hotkeys targetting applescripts...
