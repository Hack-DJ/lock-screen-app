Window Movers
====

These scripts are for moving windows around your desktop. It is intended to mimic similar behavior from MS Windows. You will need a separate tool, such as [QuickSilver](http://qsapp.com) or [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com), [Launch it!](http://launchitapp.com) and likely various others. I can personally only speak for QuickSilver.

Current implementation expects the application developers to have properly compiled in some AppleScript support. Of course, not all developers do, thus, these scripts don't always work :( I intend to get around to that, after which you'll be required to enable 'access for assistive devices'. That setting is also required for the Lock Screen script in this project.
